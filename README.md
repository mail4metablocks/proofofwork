# Proof of work

Proof of work is a concept used in many cryptocurrencies as a way to secure the network and confirm transactions. It involves solving a computational problem that is difficult to perform but easy to verify.

In a proof of work system, miners compete to solve a mathematical puzzle by guessing a number, called a nonce. When a miner finds a solution, they present it to the rest of the network along with the transactions they want to confirm. Other miners verify the solution and, if it is correct, add the block of transactions to the blockchain.

The difficulty of the puzzle is adjusted so that it takes an average of a certain amount of time to find a solution. This helps to ensure that the network remains secure and that transactions are processed in a timely manner.

Proof of work is just one of many approaches to achieving consensus in a decentralized network. It has been successful in securing the networks of many cryptocurrencies, but it has also been criticized for its high energy consumption and potential for centralization.
